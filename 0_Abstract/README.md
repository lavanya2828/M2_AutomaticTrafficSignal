Abstract

The overall idea of the project is to implement Automatic traffic signal with ATmega328p as the main controller. The digital pins are connected to the 16x2 LCD Hd44780 with 16 columns and 2 rows. LCD is used in 4 bit mode,i.e only D4-D7 of LCD is used inorder to save the pins of IC.
When the vehicle enters the traffic zone it waits for the signal. When the green signal comes it strats to move ,when the yellow signal comes it waits , and when the red signal comes it stops.The LCD display will display the message whether to go ,wait ,or stop according to the color of the signal. Thre are 4 roads joining containing different signals.
