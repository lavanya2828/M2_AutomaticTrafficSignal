 4Ws and 1Hs
 
  Who- traffic police can use this to reduce the burden
  What- The aim of the projectAutomatic traffic Signal is to simulate and implement  using Atmega328p, 16x2 LCD, RGY LED
  When- It will be helpful lowcost, simple and economical.
  Where- Useful in heavy traffic places like big cities,towns etc.
  How - It can be implemented using automatic programming also sensors can be used to detect the density of traffic.
